## Project Overview
This repository follows the **same top-down teaching philosophy** used in the original textbook:

1. Application-layer protocols and network applications  
2. Transport-layer services and congestion control  
3. Network-layer forwarding, routing, and control  
4. Link-layer protocols and local area networks  

Each chapter provides:
- Simplified explanations
- Rewritten examples
- Clarifications for difficult topics
- Study-oriented notes for revision
